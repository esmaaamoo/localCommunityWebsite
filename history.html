                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>Lenggong is situated in the Lenggong Valley, sandwiched between the Bintang and Titiwangsa Ranges. It is a rural area, with small kampongs surrounded
                   by green vegetation and limestone hills with numerous caves. The Lenggong Valley is one of Peninsular Malaysia's most important areas for archaeology,
                   as excavations have revealed many traces of Malaysia's prehistory, with finds such as cave drawings, jewellery, pottery, weapons and stone tools.
                   It is the site of one of the oldest known place of human activity in the Peninsula. The Lenggong Valley was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site on 30 June 2012.</p>

                <h2>Outstanding Universal Value</h2>
                <p>Evidence from open-air and cave sites along the Perak River in the verdant Lenggong Valley on the Malay Peninsula spans all the eras of hominid history outside of Africa, from 1.83 million to 1,700 years ago.
                    Unaltered in the moment Paleolithic stone tool workshops are dated in a long historical sequence and found on the edges of old river gravel beds and paleolakes.
                    The Palaeolithic artifacts at Bukit Bunuh, where hand axes are among the earliest discovered outside of Africa, were preserved due to a meteorite strike that occurred 1.83 million years ago that obstructed and diverted the river. An very early date for the presence of hominids in South-East Asia is provided by analysis that indicates these were manufactured by hominids.
                    A disastrous volcanic eruption of Toba around 70,000 b.p. led to the abandonment of a workshop site that contained multiple tool types at Kota Tampan. Other workshop sites date from 200,000-100,000 BP at Bukit Jawa, 40,000 BP at Bukit Bunuh and 1000 BP at Gua Harimau.</p>

                <p>
                    These sites' relative abundance suggests a sizable or somewhat permanent population.
                    Perak Inside the Gua Gunung Runtuh cave, a man was found. South-East Asia's oldest and most complete human skeleton is that of Perak Man. It has a radiocarbon dating of 10,120 BP and is recognized as an Australomelanesoid, a type of hominid that lived in continental South-East Asia and the western Indonesian archipelago at the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene.
                    There are twenty caves at Bukit Kepala Gajah, a sizable karst outcrop. Prehistoric graves have been discovered on three of these, Gua Gunung Runtuh, Gua Teluk Kelawar, and Gua Kajang.
                    When taken as a whole, these four locations in two clusters show the most significant phases of human history in the area.
